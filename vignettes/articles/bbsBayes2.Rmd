Welcome! Let's get you started with bbsBayes2.

First we'll make sure we have the right software installed, we'll fetch the 
breeding bird data, and then we'll run through some example workflows.



## Install [cmdstanr](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/)

Because bbsBayes2 uses Stan to run the Bayesian models, we need to make
sure we have cmdstanr and cmdstan both installed.

It is recommended to run this is a fresh R session or restart your current
session
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", 
                                       getOption("repos")))
```

If you're having troubles, try increasing the timeout limits. Keep in mind, the installation of cmdstanr may take several tries, do not lose hope!
```{r}
options(timeout=1000)
```

Now we should be able to use cmdstanr to install cmdstan
```{r, eval = FALSE}
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

Let's check that everything went as planned

```{r}
cmdstanr::cmdstan_path()
cmdstanr::cmdstan_version()
```

## Download BBS data

Now we'll fetch the BBS data using functions included in bbsBayes2.

> Note that most bbsBayes2 functionality can be explored **without** downloading
> BBS data by using the included sample data. Specify `sample_data = TRUE`
> in the first `stratify()` step (see the next section). 

First we'll load the package.
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(bbsBayes2)
```

There are four types of BBS data that can be downloaded:

- Two levels `state` and `stop` (only `state` works with bbsBayes2 models)
- Two releases `2020` and `2022`

Unless you have a specific reason to need a different version, the default 
(level `state` and release `2022`) is likely the one you want. However
you can download all data sets and specify which one you wish to use in the
`stratify()` step.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fetch_bbs_data()                  # Default
fetch_bbs_data(release = "2020")  # Specify a different release
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = !have_bbs_data()}
fetch_bbs_data()
```

## Workflow

Now that you have cmdstanr installed and the BBS data downloaded, we'll walk
through a general workflow for modelling species trends with bbsBayes2.

### Stratify the data

The first step in any bbsBayes2 analysis is to stratify the data. 
In this step we choose a stratification type as well as a species to explore. 

```{r, eval = have_bbs_data()}
s <- stratify(by = "bbs_usgs", species = "Snowy Owl")
```

We can also play around with the included sample data (Pacific Wrens)
```{r}
s <- stratify(by = "bbs_cws", sample_data = TRUE) # Only Pacific Wren
```

Stratifications included in bbsBayes2 are 
`r paste0(names(bbs_strata), collapse = ", ")`. 
See the articles on
[stratifications](articles/stratification) and 
[custom stratifications](articles/custom_stratification) for more details and 
examples.

Available species can be explore using the `search_species()` function. Note: if you're just messing around with the package we recommend using range restricted species such as the Hepatic Tanager, Pacific Wren, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher and Cerulean Warbler.

### Prepare the data

Once we have stratified the data, we can now prepare it for use in a model. 
In this step data will be filtered to omit routes with too few samples, etc.
See `prepare_data()` for more details on how you can customize this step.

```{r}
p <- prepare_data(s)
```

### Prepare the model

Next we will prepare the model parameters and initialization values.
See `prepare_model()` for more details on how you can customize this step.

```{r}
md <- prepare_model(p, model = "first_diff")
```


### Run model

Now we can run the model.

The default `iter_sampling` and `iter_warmup` are 1000 and the default `chains`
is 4. In the interest of speed for this example, we are using much lower values,
but note that this almost certainly will result in problems with our model.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
m <- run_model(md, iter_sampling = 100, iter_warmup = 500, chains = 2)
```

OR you can skip this step for now, and test out package features using one of our finished models: HERE.
```{r}
m<-readRDS("HETA_bbs_usgs_gamye.rds")
```

### A note on spatial models
For spatial models there's two additional steps. You stratify and prepare the data as in the previous example, but you also prepare the map and the spatial data. An example is below.
```{r}
s <- stratify(by = "bbs_cws", species="Hepatic Tanager") 
p <- prepare_data(s)

#now the additional steps
#load a map
map<-load_map(stratify_by = "bbs_cws")
#prepare the spatial data
sp<-prepare_spatial(p,map)

#then prepare the model with the spatial output
mod <- prepare_model(sp, model = "first_diff",model_variant = "spatial")

#then run the model as before
m <- run_model(mod, iter_sampling = 100, iter_warmup = 500, chains = 2)
```


### Explore the model outputs

First we will generate indices according to different regional categories.
By default these are `continent` and `stratum`. 

```{r}
i <- generate_indices(model_output = m)
```

We can visually explore these indices by accessing the `indices` item in the list

```{r}
i[["indices"]]
```

We can also plot these indicies. 

```{r}
p <- plot_indices(indices = i, add_observed_means = TRUE)
```

Note that we get one plot for each region and regional category, in this case
that means one plot for the continent, and one for each stratum.

```{r}
names(p)
```

We can plot them individually by pulling a plot out of the list

```{r}
p[["continent"]]
p[["CA_AB_10"]]
```

Next we can calculate the specific trends based on these indices

```{r}
t <- generate_trends(i)
```

We can plot these on a map

```{r}
plot_map(t)
```

###Example models
A model with a suitable number of iterations takes a long time to run (the barn swallow model below took 54 hours)! Below are three full models run with 1000 iterations and four chains. Use these to test out some of the features!
